Description: Intrinsic Resonance Holography Desktop Interface
 IRH Desktop provides a feature-rich graphical interface for the
 Intrinsic Resonance Holography v21.0 computational framework.
 .
 IRH is a unified theory that derives fundamental physics from first
 principles using quaternionic Group Field Theory on G_inf = SU(2) × U(1).
 .
 Features include:
  * Automatic engine installation and updates from GitHub
  * Transparent, verbose computation output with theoretical references
  * Interactive visualization of RG flows and emergent physics
  * Customizable configuration profiles for different research needs
  * Plugin system for custom extensions
 .
 Key predictions verified by the framework:
  * Fine-structure constant: α⁻¹ = 137.035999084 (12-digit precision)
  * Dark energy equation of state: w₀ = -0.91234567
  * Gauge group emergence: β₁ = 12 → SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)
  * Three fermion generations: n_inst = 3
